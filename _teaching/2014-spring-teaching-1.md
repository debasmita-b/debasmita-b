I also took part in a variety of teaching opportunities as an undergraduate and master's student at Cornell.

Graduate Teaching Assistantship
======
In Spring 2021, I designed and tested one-third of the programming assignments for Language and Information (CS 4300), covering applications of information retrieval and analysis of textual data. I also graded course assignments, hosted weekly office hours for 200+ students, and led 20% of the semester's weekly staff meetings of 20+ graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants. 

Undergraduate Teaching Assistantships
======
In Spring 2019, I co-led a biweekly discussion section and facilitated problem solving in Physics I: Mechanics and Heat (PHYS 1112).

In Fall 2020, I hosted weekly office hours for 150+ undergraduate and graduate students in Natural Language Processing (CS 4740), covering course concepts and project implementation. I also graded course assessments and provided individualized, constructive feedback to students.


Academic Excellence Workshops
======
In Fall 2019 and 2020, I co-led a weekly supplementary course for Engineering General Chemistry (CHEM 2090). In Spring 2020, I co-led a weekly supplementary course for Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures (CS 2110). Across all three semesters of teaching, I delivered lectures to groups of 20 first-year students and designed problem sets to reinforce understanding of course material through active learning techniques.

Volunteer Teaching
======
In Fall 2018, I collaborated with fellow members of [Women in Computing at Cornell (WICC)](https://wicc.cornell.edu/#/) to teach 40+ middle schoolers basic computing concepts in JavaScript on a weekly basis.
