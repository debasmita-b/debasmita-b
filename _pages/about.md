About me
======
Hello! I'm a third-year PhD student in computer science at Columbia University. I am grateful to be advised by [Professor Julia Hirschberg](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/) as a member of the [Spoken Language Processing Group](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/speech/). I'm broadly interested in multilingual and dialectal natural language and speech processing and computational linguistics. My research so far has focused on code-switching, applying techniques from computational paralinguistics and discourse analysis.

Prior to Columbia, I earned my BSc and MEng at Cornell University, where I majored in computer science and minored in linguistics. At Cornell, I was fortunate to work with [Professor Thomas Davidson](https://www.thomasrdavidson.com/) and [Professor Marten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/). 

As of Fall 2022, I am a [Croucher Scholar](https://scholars.croucher.org.hk/). My graduate work is supported by an NSF EAGER Award (2023-2024) and an NSF Small Grant (2024-2027).
